Working with strings

John loves analysing textual information. He often reads short stories
and then tries to find the longest word in such stories. Doing this
manually takes a long time so we'd like to help him automate the task. \

/Note: You are provided an example of a short story in the code editor.
The example story should not be part of your solution: it is just there
to help you./

Write a function named |get_longest_word| which accepts a single string
argument. The function should return the longest word in the given
string. Assume that words in a string can be separated with *spaces*,
*commas*, *new line characters* or *full stops*. This means that
abbreviated forms with apostrophes (e.g. |I'm|) are considered to be a
single word. If there is more than one word with the maximum number of
characters, return the first such word that exists in the string.

Example: For input |Once I'm awaken, I'll sacrifice your soul to the
ruler of darkness.| the output should be |sacrifice|.

Description

    Welcome! My name's Adrian and I'm a professional Software Developer.
    If *you already know basic Python *and want to *take another step
    with your skills*, then you've just found an excellent course for
    that! Along the way, you will also create *three practical Python
    programs*!

    According to statistics, Python is in the top 3 programming
    languages all around the world. It is *much easier and quicker to
    learn* that most other languages. At the same time, it's extremely
    popular among software developers, data analysts and other IT
    professions. All of this makes it an *excellent choice for your
    first programming language*.


    *COURSE OVERVIEW  *

    In this course, you'll learn intermediate-level Python 3 and you'll
    get prepared for the Certified Associate in Python Programming exam
    (PCAP). You will need basic Python skills (entry-level PCEP exam
    knowledge) to start this course. I'll show you how to install Python
    and all the necessary tools. You will code along with me andhave a
    chance to write three practical programs to practice your skills.

    There are 5 exam blocks when you sit the PCAP exam. Consequently,
    this course has 5 main modules, each one focusing on a different
    exam block. At the end of each module, you'll have a chance to
    *solve an exam quiz* to check your skills.

    This course also comes with a *mock PCAP exam* at the very end. It
    will have the same format as your actual exam, with the same passing
    grade and time limit. It will show you what kinds of questions you
    can expect.


    *COURSE ADVANTAGES*

    • *concise* – the short video lectures focus on the most important
    aspects: there are just a few hours of videos to get you started ASAP

    • *based on practice* – instead of useless academic theory, you
    learn the best developing practices drawn from my work experience,

    • *reasonably priced* – compared to stationary developer bootcamps,
    the course is much cheaper, so you save not only time but also money,

    • *available anywhere, anytime* – the online form lets you run the
    course in the most convenient place (at home, work or in a café) and
    time (while commuting by metro or relaxing at home after work), so
    you can adjust it to your agenda,

    • *accessible on desktop, mobile and TV* – you can display my
    lectures on the device of your choice, so you don’t have to stick to
    your PC,

    • *certificate of completion* – after completing the course, you
    will receive a printable certificate that will make your resume more
    attractive.


            What you’ll learn

      * Take the next step in Python: from beginner to intermediate level
      * Prepare for PCAP-31-0x exam
      * Get intermediate Python skills for Software Development, Data
        Science, Machine Learning etc.
      * Apply for entry-level Python jobs
      * Code along with me for real-life programming practice
      * Create three practical programs


            Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?

      * Basic Python knowledge (PCEP-level knowledge)
      * A device with Internet access
      * Willingness to learn :)


            Who this course is for:

      * People who want to pass the PCAP Associate-Level exam
      * People who passed the PCEP entry-level exam and want to continue
        studying
      * Beginners with some basic programming experience
      * Wanna-be software developers and data analysts
      * People who need intermediate Python for Machine Learning, Data
        Science and Artificial Intelligence

    Hi!

    My name’s Adrian and I’m a *senior* *software developer*. I
    specialise in back-end languages such as *Java *and *Python*. My
    programmer portfolio also includes lots of database technologies:
    *both SQL and NoSQL databases*. I hold a Master’s Degree in Computer
    Science.

    I have over 8 years of experience**teaching people IT online. What
    makes my courses special is their *practical background *– I’m an
    active developer, not an IT theorist, so I know the best practices.
    I also know what programming skills are in demand.

    *My courses are:*

    - *based on practice* so that you don’t learn useless theory,

    - *straight to the point* to save your time,

    - *easily digestible *because I want you to understand it
    all without problems.

Hi Adrian,Enjoying the PCEP and PCAP courses so far. Thanks for the
clear explanations.QUESTION:- Should we pack as much code into
MODULES as possible, in order to optimise speed at runtime?I gather the
actual code execution will be at the same (very slow) speed as in both
instances Python is translating bytecode and executing it. However, in a
lengthy project, if modules are by definition always pre-"compiled" to
bytecode (.pyc), then the initial overheads (ie compiling from source --
> bytecode) should be reduced if the bulk of the code is housed in
modules... ?Cheers,ChrisCanberra, Australia
